# Nand2Tetris-Project9
My implementation of Project 9 from Nand2Tetris course - game designed to test players' reflexes and accuracy under time constraints in Jack language

# Nand2Tetris - Project 9

This repository contains my solution for **Project 9** from the Nand2Tetris course.  
The project focuses on building basic operating system components written in **Jack language**.

## 🛠️ Implemented Files:
- `Math.jack`  
- `Array.jack`  
- `String.jack`  
- `Output.jack`  
- `Screen.jack`  
- `Keyboard.jack`  

## 📝 Description:
In this project, I implemented several essential OS services in Jack, enabling higher-level programs to interact with hardware components.

## 🚀 How to Run:
1. Use the supplied **Jack compiler** and **VM emulator** from the Nand2Tetris toolset.
2. Compile each `.jack` file to VM code.
3. Load the VM files into the **VM emulator** to test the functionality.

## 💡 Key Learnings:
- Understanding low-level OS services.
- Writing efficient and structured Jack code.
- Bridging high-level programming and hardware simulation.
